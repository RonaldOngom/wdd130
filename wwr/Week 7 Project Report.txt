Week 7 Project Report
Student Name: Ongom Ronald
Course: CSE 111

Time Spent (50%)
I spent approximately 12 hours this week completing my Week 7 project. Time was spent on:
    • Finalizing program functions
    • Adding the add_sale function and updating existing functions
    • Writing and verifying pytest tests
    • Debugging import errors and file path issues
    • Creating a sample CSV file for sales data

Organization (30%)
My program is organized into multiple functions, each performing a single task:
    • load_sales_data: Reads CSV sales data
    • add_sale: Adds or updates a sale record
    • calculate_subtotal: Computes subtotal of all sales
    • apply_discount: Applies discount logic (none or BOGO)
    • calculate_tax: Computes tax based on subtotal
    • sales_analytics: Prints analytics for total sales and top items
    • generate_receipt: Prints a formatted receipt
Each function is independent, reusable, and testable with pytest.

Progress (20%)
Significant progress has been completed this week:
    • Implemented add_sale and updated all supporting functions
    • Integrated CSV sales data processing
    • Implemented discounts (BOGO and no discount)
    • Implemented receipt generation
    • Implemented sales analytics output
    • Created pytest tests for all functions
    • Debugged all import and runtime errors
    • Verified all tests pass successfully
The program now runs correctly without errors and meets all assignment requirements.
